**CyberNeuro** is a futuristic, high-performance front-end web platform that visualizes the convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Military-Grade Cybersecurity.

Designed with a "Sci-Fi Enterprise" aesthetic, this project features advanced CSS animations, particle network backgrounds, and a multi-page architecture that simulates a real-world tech giant's digital presence.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Immersive Visual Experience
* **Neural Particle Network:** An interactive background system (`particles.js`) simulating active neural connections that react to mouse movement.
* **3D Holographic Animations:** CSS-only spinning "Neural Cores" and "Quantum Processors" representing the company's AI infrastructure.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Frosted glass headers, stat bars, and cards for a modern, depth-rich feel.
* **Cyberpunk Aesthetics:** A deep neon-purple and cyber-green color palette (`#6C63FF` & `#00FF88`).

### 🏗️ Advanced Architecture
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Complete ecosystem including Home, Approach, Services, Cybersecurity, Technology, and Contact pages.
* **Zig-Zag Layouts:** Engaging alternating content sections for deep-dive technical pages.
* **Responsive Grid Systems:** "Bento-box" style grids for features and statistics that adapt flawlessly to mobile devices.

### ⚡ Interactive Elements
* **Typewriter Effect:** Dynamic text generation in hero sections.
* **Custom Cursor:** A glowing, expanding ring cursor that replaces the default pointer for a native app feel.
* **Scroll Animations:** Content fades and slides into view as the user explores the page.
* **Testimonial Slider:** A fully functional, touch-responsive slider for client reviews.
